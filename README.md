Document status: scribble on a napkin

this is a sketch of a little "we value X over Y" type microsite where you can sign your name at the bottom and say "yeah, I also value X over Y". The gist is "people over LLMs" but that's trite... it needs improvement.

# Fist Draft / Napkin Scribble

(obviously needs a lot of work, but it's here to give us something to correct/improve.)

> We value people and will not be using LLMs

# TODO

- [ ] gather a few people who are interested in making this happen; grant them admin rights to this repo
- [ ] discuss stuff in issues
- [ ] come up with a descriptive name and some insightful prose that describes the view
- [ ] gather a list of employers that hold the same view
- [ ] gather a list of resources (blogs, videos) that advance the view
- [ ] make some way for folks to sign their name to it or something like that
- [ ] deploy the microsite at a short, memorable domain name

# Want to get involved?

Please [open a GitHub issue on this repo](https://github.com/alexanderbird/ai-last/issues/new) with a paragraph or two about what you think about this subject. We're at the "gather various opinions and find interested people" stage.
